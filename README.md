# face-tracking-robotic-head
AI-powered robotic head that detects and tracks human faces in real time using OpenCV. A Python vision system sends coordinates to an ESP32, which drives servos via PCA9685 for pan–tilt motion. Demonstrates computer vision, embedded control, and hardware–software integration.
